# Introduction to GIS
## Overview
In this lecture we provide the context for GIS in public policy. The objectives are:
- Introduce the concept of spatial thinking
- Define GIS
- Provide an overview of motivations for and applications of GIS in public policy

## Spatial Thinking

The focus of this course is on developing:
- spatial *thinking*
- spatial *skills*

## GIS
The acronym GIS can take on multiple meanings:

- Geographic Information *Systems* or GISystems
- Geographic Information *Services* or GIServices
- Geographic Information *Science* or GIScience
### Geographic Information Systems 
- *Geographic*: refers to a specific on or in relation to the Earth's surface
- *Information*: data to which some value or interpretation has been added
- *Systems*: a system designed to perform a wide range of function on and with GI 

### Geographic Information Services
- Provision of services
- Location based services
- Private and Government

###  Geographic Information Science

- The *science* behind GISystems
- Coined by [Michael Goodchild]() in 1992
- Acronym: **GISCIENCE**

## GIS and Public Policy

### Why GIS and Public Policy?

- Everything we do takes place at some time and *some place*
- Spatial *context* matters
- Policy implementation should consider geographical dimensions
- Policy evaluation (analysis) from a spatial perspective

### Positive Applications of GIS in Public Policy

- Using GIS to do policy analysis
- GIS derived measures
- Spatial externalities and spillovers
- Monitoring


Using GIS to *describe the world*
